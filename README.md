# BiometricLockbox
Fingerprint enabled Lockbox built for BU's Microprocessor course, EC450.

Hardware: 

2 MSP 430's (I need to double check but I believe the specific model is MSP430G2553)

Sparkfun 16x2 serial LCD screen

Small Servo motor (I need to double check what we used specifically but all it needs to do is rotate to lock and unlock)

GT511 UART Fingerprint Scanner (I need to double check again, but I think it was Fingerprint Scanner TTL GT511C1R - 3.3V to 6V)

The wiring diagram will be uploaded soon.
